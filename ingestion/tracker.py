"""Incremental ingestion tracker.

Keeps a manifest (SQLite) of every file's content hash and when it was
last ingested. On each ingestion run: unchanged files are skipped
entirely; only new or changed files get (re)chunked and (re)embedded.

Ported near-verbatim from enterprise-agentic-rag — content-hash tracking
is entirely domain-agnostic. The PubMed connector uses its OWN tracking
(by PMID + fetch date, not file hash — see ingestion/connectors/pubmed.py)
since PubMed records aren't files on disk.
