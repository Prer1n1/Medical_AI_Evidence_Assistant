"""Loader interface every format-specific loader implements.

Why an abstract base at all: it forces every loader (PDF/DOCX/HTML) to
return the same shape (List[Document]), which is what lets the rest of
the pipeline treat all formats identically. Ported verbatim from
enterprise-agentic-rag — format dispatch is domain-agnostic.
